# Update records in Zoho CRM

In Zoho CRM, you can update records using scripts, which is essential when you need to perform verifications or apply criteria that low-code cannot address.

To update a record, it is necessary to create a mapping with the field you want to update.

In this example, I created a script that acts as an action in a workflow. In this way, there is a trigger that obtains the ID of my record through argument mapping.

```javascript


Update a record:

//Argument Mapping: dealId = Deals.Deals Id

deal = zoho.crm.getRecordById("Deals",dealId);
clientType = deal.get("Client_Type");

if(clientType == "New")
{   
    amount = deal.get("Amount);
	commission = amount * (10/100);

    mp = Map();
	mp.put("Commission", commission);
    mp.put("Description", "Commission calculated with 10%");
	update = zoho.crm.updateRecord("Deals",dealId,mp);
	info update;
}
else if (clientType == "Old")
{
    amount = deal.get("Amount);
	commission = amount * (20/100);

    mp = Map();
	mp.put("Commission", commission);
    mp.put("Description", "Commission calculated with 20%");
	update = zoho.crm.updateRecord("Deals",dealId,mp);
	info update;
}
