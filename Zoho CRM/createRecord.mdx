# Create records in Zoho CRM

In Zoho CRM, scripts are created when we need to perform very specific actions that low-code solutions cannot address. 
In these cases, we can create new records in any module, provided we fill in the required fields (through mapping)for those entries and follow the 
specifications for each module.

You can also fill in fields that are not mandatory.


```javascript

//Argument Mapping: accountId = Account.Account Id

account = zoho.crm.getRecordById("Accounts",accountId);
account_name = account.get("Account_Name");
owner = account.get("Owner");
invoicing = account.get("invoicing");
currentDate = today;

if(invoicing > 1000000)
{
	mp = Map();
	mp.put("Layout",xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx); 
	//If you have more than one layout in your module, you need to identify it in the mapping using the ID.
	mp.put("Pipeline", "Prospection");
	mp.put("Deal_Name", account_name + );
	mp.put("Stage","Start");
	mp.put("Account_Name",accountId);
	mp.put("Owner",proprietario);
	mp.put("Amount",invoicing.toNumber());
	mp.put("Closing_forecast",currentDate.addMonth(6));
    mp.put("Description", "Automatically created Deal");
	create = zoho.crm.createRecord("Deals",mp);
	info create;
}
```
